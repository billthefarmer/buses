<h1>Buses</h1>
<p>
  This app is a geographical bus stop and bus times finder.
</p>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
  Scroll and zoom the map to find a bus stop and tap the map to get
  bus times from that stop.
</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>
  There are several ways of finding bus times:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Tap the map</b> &ndash; </li>
  <li> <b>Tap the search button</b> &ndash; Type in a street name and
    town, or postcode and tap the button on the search widget or
    keyboard. This will show a list of locations and bus stops.</li>
  <li> <b>Tap the search button</b> &ndash; Type in the eight
    character code on the bus stop sign, if it exists, and tap the
    button on the search widget or keyboard. This will show a list of
    bus times.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>
  The map shows a person icon in a blue shaded circle. The size of the
  circle indicates the accuracy of the location. If the app thinks you
  are moving, the person icon is replaced by an arrow. The current
  time and date, OS six figure reference, and OS twelve figure
  reference are shown in the left upper corner of the map. The current
  longitude, latitude, altitude and accuracy are shown in the right
  upper corner of the map. If the map is panned, these figures will
  change to the current map centre. After a delay they will revert to
  the current GPS location.
</p>
<h3>Navigate</h3>
<p>
  You can pan and zoom the map using pinch, expand, and swipe
  gestures, and by using the zoom in and out buttons. The floating
  blue <b>Locate</b> button will return the map to your current
  location. The button icon centre is filled in once the app has a GPS
  location.
</p>
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>
  The app will ask for location and file access permissions. The
  location permission is to find out where you are. The file access
  permission is so the mapping function can cache map tiles. If map
  tiles are cached, there is a limited amount of mapping available
  without internet access, otherwise map tiles will be downloaded
  every time the app is used.
